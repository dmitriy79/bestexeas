From the B&C Exchange repository root build the bcegitian/base image:

    docker build -t bcegitian/base $PWD/contrib/gitian-docker

Then the bcegitian/setup image:

    ID=`docker run --privileged -d -v $PWD:/bcexchange -t bcegitian/base /setup.sh` && docker attach $ID
    docker commit $ID bcegitian/setup

If the setup fails you should still commit the container to save the current state. Then you can start the container to complete the jobs manually and commit again:

    ID=`docker run --privileged -d -v $PWD:/bcexchange -ti bcegitian/setup bash` && docker attach $ID
    service apt-cacher-ng start
    cd gitian-builder
    # finish the setup process manually and exit the container
    docker commit $ID bcegitian/setup


Then you must choose to either build from your local repository or from the official repository.

To build from your local repository:

* modify `contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml` and `contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win.yml`: replace the line `- "url": "git@bitbucket.org:JordanLeePeershares/bcexchange.git"` with `- "url": "/bcexchange"`
* start the container with `docker run --privileged -ti -w /gitian-builder -v $PWD:/bcexchange bcegitian/setup bash`

To build from the official repository start the container with this command:

    docker run --privileged -ti -w /gitian-builder -v $PWD:/bcexchange bcegitian/setup bash

Then you're inside the container. Verify KVM is working:

    kvm-ok

Start apt-cacher-ng:

    service apt-cacher-ng start

Then define the version you want to build (v$VERSION must be an annotated tag on the target repository):

    export VERSION=3.0.0-RC1

Then to build the Linux binaries:

    ./bin/gbuild --commit bcexchange=v${VERSION} ../bcexchange/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml
    pushd build/out
    zip -r bcexchange-${VERSION}-linux-gitian.zip *
    mv bcexchange-${VERSION}-linux-gitian.zip /bcexchange
    popd

And to build the Windows binaries:

    ./bin/gbuild --commit bcexchange=v${VERSION} ../bcexchange/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win.yml
    pushd build/out
    zip -r bcexchange-${VERSION}-win-gitian.zip *
    mv bcexchange-${VERSION}-win-gitian.zip /bcexchange
    popd
