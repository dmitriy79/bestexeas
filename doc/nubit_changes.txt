# BCExchange Changes

CBitcoinAddress
---------------

Most CBitcoinAddress methods take a unit parameter. You can't have a CBitcoinAddress if you don't have an unit.


Main wallet
-----------

There's no global pwalletMain anymore.

There is instead one wallet per unit.
The wallets are in the global setpwalletRegistered (which already existed).

In init.cpp there's a local pwalletMain used when wallets are created.


RPC
---

There is one RPC server per unit.

In bitcoinrpc.cpp there's a wallet per thread, and a #define for pwalletMain to keep old code working.

The RPC servers start by default on these ports:
Main network:
Shares: 2240
nuBits: 2241

Testnet:
Shares: 12240
nuBits: 12241

When running the command line you can provide an unit to make it connect to the right port.
For example: `nud -testnet -unit=B getbalance`
